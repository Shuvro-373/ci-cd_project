        <h2>  <center><font size =30 color="green"> As we celebrate this day, I want to take a moment to remind you of how incredibly special you are to me. Nearly half a decade has passed since we first began this journey together, and every moment, every challenge, every joy, and every memory has only made my love for you grow stronger.

Through the highs and lows, when I had nothing, you stood by me—offering your love, support, and unwavering belief in us. That has meant more than words can ever express. You’ve been my rock, my light, and my greatest strength, and now, with everything that I have and all that I am, I want to be the same for you.</font></center> </h2> <br>
        <h3> <center> <b><i><font size =25 color="black"> I can't imagine spending another day without you by my side. You are the love of my life, and I want to grow old with you, continue to face life's challenges with you, and share all of the beautiful moments that the future holds. Together, we’ve built something so beautiful and unbreakable, and I can’t wait to see what comes next, as long as it’s with you.

Thank you for being my everything. Happy Valentine’s Day, my love. Here’s to a lifetime more together.

With all my heart </font></i></b> </center> </h3> <br>
